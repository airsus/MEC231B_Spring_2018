%% Q5
% We found that RRT is not very sensitive to map configuration, moreover
% when the degree of freedom increases, the complexity increases far more
% quickly than other methods. In order to imrove the performance, we could
% use graph search algorithme in the lower dimensional basics (to get path
% for X and Y) and then use RRT to expand the whole configuration.

%% Q6
% We can use PID or MPC to improve the performance in RRT.
